                      <h2>The Magnificent Taj Mahal</h2>      
                        <p> 
                          As part of India's golden triangle, the city of Agra is one of the travel hotspots of the world. 
                          Agra, home to the Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world, is rich in its history and architecture. 
                          Taj Mahal, an epitome of love, is regarded as an astounding architectural beauty and has continuously 
                          been on the 'Seven Wonders of the World' list. Taj Mahal was constructed for a period of 22 years, and 
                          a total of about twenty thousand workers were employed to build it. This architectural marvel is built entirely of 
                          white marble and it glows in the moonlight. Shah Jahan built this monument in the memory of his wife Mumtaz, 
                          whose grave is housed within the premises of the Taj Mahal. There are several other aspects that create the 
                          spectacle that the Taj Mahal is â€” beautiful Charbaghs(Taj Garden), the magnificent Darwaza,the symmetrical 
                          sandstone structures surrounding the Taj, and the placid Yamuna river that flows behind it.
